# Shanghai Urban Data Challenge

## Introduction

This annual 30-hour hackathon aims to help university students understand the opportunities created by the new age of data. 
It will further challenge them to handle large datasets and develop solutions in an intensive, limited time frame while working within interdisciplinary teams of engineers, designers, and business students. 
This skill set is highly demanded in companies in almost all domains and industries. 
Throughout the hackathon, data science and machine learning professors, as well as business leaders, will mentor them while letting them free to explore.

At the conclusion of the hackathon, student teams must demo their model, prediction results and innovative solutions to an audience comprised of faculty members, experts, and external judges.

## 2019 challenge theme

“Predict well-being out of raw urban data”
Cities, researchers, and private companies are collecting a huge quantity of data with the objective to measure, predict and improve the satisfaction and well-being of their local communities or customers.
Taking the results of a research study conducted in 2018/2019 by the School of Sociology of Shanghai University, this hackathon will give you the opportunity to explore the subjective well-being of more than 400 communities located in Shanghai-based on 3 environmental variables:
- Surroundings beauty & cleanliness
- Noise
- Smell, odor
- ...

## How to proceed ?
### Stage 1
Build a model that predicts urban citizens’ subjective well-being using various other datasets.
More accurate predictions may allow cities and private companies to design relevant products and services to specifically targeted communities and ultimately improve their living environment and well-being.
### Stage 2
Based on the first findings and intuitions, the team will also have to imagine a new product/service with a sustainable business model.
### Stage 3
Demo a prototype of the proposed solution at the end of the hackathon.
